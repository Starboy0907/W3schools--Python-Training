Python - Output Variables
Output Variables
The Python print statement is often used to output variables.

To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

Example
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)
You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:

Example
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)
For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

Example
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
